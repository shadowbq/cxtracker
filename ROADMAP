## cxtracker roadmap

# Version 2.0
  * We need to support other methods for fast packetcapture/0copy etc.
  * libpcap 1.0.0+ support and pcap_set_buffer_size etc.
  * support for using afpacket on linux

# Version 1.5
  * Limiting packet-capture on bytes or packets in a session:
    - Drop capturing after XXXX packets or YYYY bytes
      - based on sessions
      - configurable for client and server separatly
      - Update pcap indexing to Cohere
  * Limiting packet-capture for know SSL/TLS/Encrypted traffic
    - Maybe check payload for content and if it matches within
      the first 20 packets, dont log anymore ?!!?
      - Maybe mark the IP+Port of the server as encrypted for
        future 'skip inspection' ?

# Version 1.0
  * Sniff traffic from interface (-i)
  * Read pcap files (-r)
  * Specify output format (-f)
  * Specify BPF (-b)
  * Specify directory to write cxtracker logs to (-d)
  * Drop priveleges ( -u and -g)
  * Chroot (-T)
  * Specify pidfile (-p and -P)
  * Write pcap to file  (-w)
  * Pcap roleover (-s and -t)
  * Pcap indexing in cxtracker output
